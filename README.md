## comp20-nshashok

This repository holds the individual work I have completed over the course of Comp 20 at Tufts University.

Out of the labs and assignments I completed, my favorite was Assignment 3, where we had to create a geolocation API server that can serve content to the Assignment 2 pages. This was my first time building a large functional server-side application and I enjoyed the design and implementation process.

This class has taught me not just how to do web programming, but how to be a good programmer and engineer and how to interact with the computer science community; in this field I feel I have grown the most.

The most important things I have learned in this course, apart from the things mentioned above, are how to work successfully with asynchronous code and Javascript, and how to manage client, server and database interactions without causing mayhem and havoc.

I'd love to delve deeper into the server side of things, learning about more advanced techniques for computers to interact over the Internet.
